## 🔥 What is StackLens?

**StackLens** is a powerful developer tool that scans any codebase and instantly generates a clear, visual representation of the technologies, frameworks, libraries, and architecture being used.

Whether you're:

* 🧑‍💻 Onboarding to a new team
* 🔍 Reviewing an open-source repo
* 🏗 Planning architecture improvements
* 🤝 Doing tech due diligence
* ⚡ Evaluating a startup’s stack

StackLens gives you **clarity in seconds**.

---

## 🎯 Why StackLens?

Modern codebases are complex.

You clone a repo and see:

* 200+ dependencies
* 15 folders
* 8 config files
* Unknown frameworks
* Mystery architecture

Instead of spending hours digging…

👉 Run **StackLens**
👉 Get a visual tech stack breakdown
👉 Understand the system instantly

## 🧠 What It Detects

StackLens analyzes your project to identify:

* ⚙️ Backend frameworks (Node, Django, Flask, etc.)
* 🎨 Frontend frameworks (React, Vue, Angular, etc.)
* 🗄 Databases
* 📦 Key dependencies
* ☁️ Cloud & infra hints
* 🧪 Testing frameworks
* 📊 Architecture patterns
* 🧩 Monorepo structures
* 🛠 Dev tools & build systems

---

## 📊 What You Get

* 🖼 Tech stack visualization
* 🗺 High-level architecture overview
* 📄 Stack summary report
* 📈 Clean dependency insights
* 🚀 Shareable output

Perfect for:

* README enhancement
* Tech documentation
* Investment decks
* Architecture reviews
* Internal onboarding

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rahuldongre-us/stack-lens.git
cd stack-lens
```
Before running code, set the environment variable GEMINI_API_KEY.

* [Gemini Docs](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs)
* [Set API Environment Variable](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key#set-api-env-var)


Run the stack generator:

```bash
# If using Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook stack-generator.ipynb
```

Or integrate into your workflow:

```bash
python stack_generator.py /path/to/project
```

Provide the path to your codebase and get instant insights.

* Tech Stack: [Tech Stack Sample](assets/response-gem-stack.md)
* Architecture Diagram: ![Diagram Sample](assets/stack-lens-java-arch.drawio.svg)

### Why Gemini Matters for Stack Lens

Stack Lens aims to help developers better understand, explore, and query code repositories using language models. Integrating or referencing a powerful LLM like Gemini in your documentation helps communicate the underlying technology intent: leveraging state-of-the-art AI models to interpret and interact with code and natural language with high contextual understanding.

Gemini’s family includes different performance tiers — from lightweight models to the most capable variants (e.g., Gemini 3 Pro, Gemini 2.5 Flash) — allowing tool builders to balance capability and cost.
